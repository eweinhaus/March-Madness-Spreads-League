# 🔧 HEAD Request Support Fix

## 🚨 Issue Resolved
Fixed the 405 Method Not Allowed error for HEAD requests to the root endpoint `/` and other health check endpoints.

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### 1. Root Endpoint (`/`)
- **Before**: Only supported GET requests (`@app.get("/")`)
- **After**: Now supports both GET and HEAD requests (`@app.get("/")` + `@app.head("/")`)
- **Impact**: Load balancers and health checks can now use HEAD requests without getting 405 errors

### 2. Health Check Endpoint (`/health`)
- **Before**: Only supported GET requests
- **After**: Now supports both GET and HEAD requests
- **Impact**: Monitoring systems can perform lightweight health checks via HEAD

### 3. Database Health Check (`/health/db`)
- **Before**: Only supported GET requests
- **After**: Now supports both GET and HEAD requests
- **Impact**: More comprehensive health monitoring support

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Added request method logging to track GET vs HEAD requests
- Improved debugging for 405 errors (already existed)

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Test Script
A test script has been created: `test_head_requests.py`

```bash
# Test your deployed backend
python test_head_requests.py https://march-madness-backend-qyw5.onrender.com

# Expected output for successful fix:
# ✅ GET /: 200
# ✅ HEAD /: 200
# ✅ GET /health: 200
# ✅ HEAD /health: 200
# etc.
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test HEAD request to root endpoint
curl -I https://march-madness-backend-qyw5.onrender.com/

# Should return HTTP 200, not 405
```

## 🚀 Deployment

1. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix 405 Method Not Allowed: Add HEAD support to health endpoints"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Watch Render.com build logs for any errors
   - Check application logs after deployment
   - Run the test script to verify the fix

3. **Verify Fix**:
   - The original error should no longer appear:
     ```
     ERROR:main:🚨 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED: HEAD /
     ```
   - HEAD requests should return 200 OK instead of 405

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The issue occurred because:
1. **Load Balancer Behavior**: Render.com (and most hosting platforms) use HEAD requests for health checks
2. **FastAPI Default**: FastAPI doesn't automatically handle HEAD requests for GET endpoints
3. **CORS Configuration**: While CORS was configured to allow HEAD methods, the individual endpoints weren't set up to handle them

## 🎯 Root Cause
The error message showed:
```
ERROR:main:🚨 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED: HEAD /
ERROR:main:🚨 Request headers: {'host': 'march-madness-backend-qyw5.onrender.com', 'user-agent': 'Go-http-client/1.1'}
```

This was Render.com's load balancer performing a HEAD request health check, but the endpoint only supported GET requests.

## ✅ Solution Summary
- Added `@app.head("/")` decorator to root endpoint
- Added `@app.head("/health")` decorator to health endpoint  
- Added `@app.head("/health/db")` decorator to database health endpoint
- Enhanced logging to track request methods
- Created test script for verification

The fix is minimal, targeted, and maintains backward compatibility while resolving the 405 error.
